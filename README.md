## 3. Cart-Pole Swing-Up

This module demonstrates solving the cart-pole swing-up problem through two main stages: **Trajectory Generation** using the Direct Collocation (DIRCOL) method and **Trajectory Tracking** using the Time-Varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (TV-LQR) controller. The objective is to swing the pendulum from a downward position to an inverted position by applying horizontal forces to the cart.

- **Key Highlights**:
  - **Trajectory Generation**:
    - Formulates the cart-pole dynamics using symbolic computation in CasADi.
    - Implements Hermite-Simpson constraints for trajectory optimization.
    - Generates an optimal reference trajectory for the cart-pole system.
  - **Trajectory Tracking**:
    - Linearizes the system dynamics along the reference trajectory.
    - Computes time-varying LQR feedback gains using advanced discretization methods.
    - Simulates the system's response to follow the optimized trajectory.
    - Utilizes TV-LQR to achieve tracking of the reference trajectory in the presence of modeling errors.
    - Visualizes both the state/control trajectories and provides animated simulations for better understanding.
